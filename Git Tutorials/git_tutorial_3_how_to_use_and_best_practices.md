# Planning beginner git tutorial

Using a placeholder project.

## How to use:

1. gittify and push to github.

2. Make some changes, add, commit and push

3. What if I want to try something out but I don't want to ruin my code.
  - copy the folder. make the change and if you want to keep it, copy it back and push
  - don't bother with forks and other branches if you can help it. this is advanced gitting and generally you won't need to use them.

4. You can if you like use a graphical program to track your git projects

## Best Practices

These are the things that turn your git experiance from "OMG this is hard, obscure and complex" and you don't use it again to "OMG this is the best thing ever, why did no one tell me about this."

Work in a way where future you will thank you.

1. Always use commit messages. Even for small stuff.

2. Make and maintain an README allows future you and other people to actually use your code. And make it as dead simple as possible.

3. If you like, keep a text file of git commands, make it easy for yourself - you'll thank yourself.

4. Keep a to do list of changes / improvements that you want to make to your project and tick them off as you go. Helps you walk away from a project and come back to it later.
